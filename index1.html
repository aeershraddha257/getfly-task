            <h2>Artificial Intelligence-</h2>
            <p>Venue- Seminar Hall, 2nd floor, Saraswati college, Sion 
                Description- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an evolving technology that tries to simulate human intelligence using machines. AI encompasses various subfields, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning, which allow systems to learn and adapt in novel ways from training data. It has vast applications across multiple industries, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.

            <h2>Machine learning-</h2>
            <p>Venue- Seminar Hall, 2nd floor, Saraswati college, Sion 
                Description- Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that uses data and algorithms to teach machines how to perform tasks and make predictions with minimal human intervention. ML algorithms use input data to identify patterns and learn in an iterative process, gradually improving their accuracy. ML enables computers to operate autonomously without explicit programming, and can be applied to many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. When applied to business problems, it is known as predictive analytics.

            <p>Venue- Room no- 205, 2nd floor, Saraswati college, Sion 
                Description- The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects, such as devices, vehicles, and appliances, that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to allow them to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet. The goal of IoT is to create self-reporting devices that can communicate with each other and users in real time without human intervention.

            <h2>Block chain-</h2>
            <p>Venue- Room no- 212, 2nd floor, Saraswati college, Sion 
                Description- Blockchain developers have a strong mix of skills in the areas of computer networking, cryptography, and algorithms and data structures. But they also have experience with at least one specific type of blockchain, like that of bitcoin or Ethereum. It’s important to know whether you will build on existing open-source technologies: Only a rare few will succeed in making something brand new, but that’s often unnecessary.
